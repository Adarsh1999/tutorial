        "paragraph": "Newtons third law of motion states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs. First an action occurs, such as the skateboarders pushing together. Then a reaction occurs that is equal in strength to the action but in the opposite direction. In the case of the skateboarders, they move apart, and the distance they move depends on how hard they first pushed together. You can see other examples of actions and reactions in Figure 14.9. You can watch a video about actions and reactions at this URL:  You might think that actions and reactions would cancel each other out like balanced forces do. Balanced forces, which are also equal and opposite, cancel each other out because they act on the same object. Action and reaction forces, in contrast, act on different objects, so they dont cancel each other out and, in fact, often result in motion. For example, in Figure 14.9, the kangaroos action acts on the ground, but the grounds reaction acts on the kangaroo. As a result, the kangaroo jumps away from the ground. One of the action-reaction examples in the Figure 14.9 does not result in motion. Do you know which one it is? ",

Cellular respiration is a three step process. Briefly: 1. In stage one, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm of the cell in a process called glycolysis. 2. In stage two, the pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria. The mitochondria are the organelles known as the energy \"powerhouses\" of the cells (Figure 1.1). In the mitochondria, the pyruvate, which have been converted into a 2-carbon molecule, enter the Krebs cycle. Notice that mitochondria have an inner membrane with many folds, called cristae. These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place. 3. In stage three, the energy in the energy carriers enters an electron transport chain. During this step, this energy is used to produce ATP. Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP. The initial step releases just two molecules of ATP for each glucose. The later steps release much more ATP. Most of the reactions of cellular respira- tion are carried out in the mitochondria. ",

Most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures deep within Earth. But at Earths surface, temperatures and pressures are much lower.

Minerals that formed at higher temperature and pressure change into minerals that are stable at the surface. Chemical weathering is important. It starts the process of changing solid rock into soil. We need soil to grow food and create other materials we need. Chemical weathering works through chemical reactions that change the rock. There are many agents of chemical weathering.

The names of the rock types refer to the way the rocks are formed. Arrows in the diagram display how one type of rock may change to another type of rock. All igneous rocks start out as melted rock(magma) and then crystallize, or freeze. When an igneous rock is exposed on the surface, it goes through the process of weathering and erosion that breaks the rock down into smaller pieces. Wind and water carry the smaller pieces of igneous rock into piles called sediment. Through the process of compaction and cementation, the sediment gets buried and the pieces of rock become cemented together to form a new type of rock called a sedimentary rock. If a sedimentary rock is exposed at the surface, it can be eroded away and eventually changed into a new sedimentary rock. However, if a sedimentary(or an igneous) rock gets buried deep in the Earth, heat and pressure will cause profound physical and/or chemical change. This process is called metamorphosis, and the new rock is called a metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rock can also be weathered and eroded and eventually changed into a sedimentary rock. Or, if a metamorphic rock is forced deeper into the Earth, the rock can melt and become magma. Igneous rock and sedimentary rock can also be forced deep into the Earth and melt into magma.

        "paragraph": "A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. All the genes in all the members of a population make up the populations gene pool. For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles in the population. The gene pool can be described by its allele frequencies for specific genes. The frequency of an allele is the number of copies of that allele divided by the total number of alleles for the gene in the gene pool. A simple example will help you understand these concepts. The data in Table 7.2 represent a population of 100 individuals. For each gene, the gene pool has a total of 200 alleles (2 per individual x 100 individuals). The gene in question exists as two different alleles, A and a. The number of A alleles in the gene pool is 140. Of these, 100 are in the 50 AA homozygotes. Another 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. The number of a alleles in the gene pool is 60. Of these, 40 are in the 40 Aa heterozygotes. Another 20 are in the 10 aa homozygotes. The frequency of the A allele is 140/200 = 0.7.

        "paragraph": "All streams and rivers have several features in common. These features are shown in (Figure 13.5). The place where a stream or river starts is its source. The source might be a spring, where water flows out of the ground. Or the source might be water from melting snow on a mountain top. A single stream may have multiple sources. A stream or river probably ends when it flows into a body of water, such as a lake or an ocean. A stream ends at its mouth. As the water flows into the body of water, it slows down and drops the sediment it was carrying. The sediment may build up to form a delta. Several other features of streams and rivers are also shown in Figure 13.5. Small streams often flow into bigger streams or rivers. The small streams are called tributaries. A river and all its tributaries make up a river system. At certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks. The area of land that is flooded is called the floodplain. The floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly flat surface. A river flowing over a floodplain may wear away broad curves. These curves are called meanders. ",

        "paragraph": "This diagram shows about Erosion and Deposition by Glaciers. Glaciers are made up of fallen snow that, over many years, compresses into large, thickened ice masses. Glaciers form when snow remains in one location long enough to transform into ice. What makes glaciers unique is their ability to move. Due to sheer mass, glaciers flow like very slow rivers. Some glaciers are as small as football fields, while others grow to be dozens or even hundreds of kilometers long. Presently, glaciers occupy about 10 percent of the world's total land area, with most located in polar regions like Antarctica, Greenland, and the Canadian Arctic. Most glaciers lie within mountain ranges. Glaciers cause erosion by plucking and abrasion. Glaciers deposit their sediment when they melt. Landforms deposited by glaciers include drumlins, kettle lakes, and eskers. A ground moraine is a thick layer of sediments left behind by a retreating glacier. A drumlin is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by a glacier. Drumlins often occur in groups called drumlin fields. An esker is a winding ridge of sand deposited by a stream of meltwater.

        "paragraph": "This diagram shows about Erosion and Deposition by Glaciers. Glaciers are made up of fallen snow that, over many years, compresses into large, thickened ice masses. Glaciers form when snow remains in one location long enough to transform into ice. What makes glaciers unique is their ability to move. Due to sheer mass, glaciers flow like very slow rivers. Some glaciers are as small as football fields, while others grow to be dozens or even hundreds of kilometers long. Presently, glaciers occupy about 10 percent of the world's total land area, with most located in polar regions like Antarctica, Greenland, and the Canadian Arctic. Most glaciers lie within mountain ranges. Glaciers cause erosion by plucking and abrasion. Glaciers deposit their sediment when they melt. Landforms deposited by glaciers include drumlins, kettle lakes, and eskers. A ground moraine is a thick layer of sediments left behind by a retreating glacier. A drumlin is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by a glacier. Drumlins often occur in groups called drumlin fields. An esker is a winding ridge of sand deposited by a stream of meltwater. A kettle lake occurs where a chunk of ice was left behind in the sediments of a retreating glacier. When the ice melted, it left a depression. The meltwater filled it to form a lake.",

        "paragraph": "The diagram shows several features of an alpine glacier. Glaciers are masses of flowing ice that are formed when more snow falls than melts each year. Snow falls in the accumulation zone, usually the part of the glacier with the highest elevation.

        "paragraph": "Cellular respiration is the process of extracting energy in the form of ATP from the glucose in the food you eat. How does cellular respiration happen inside of the cell? Cellular respiration is a three step process. Briefly: 1. In stage one, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm of the cell in a process called glycolysis. 2. In stage two, the pyruvate molecules are transported into the mitochondria. The mitochondria are the organelles known as the energy \"powerhouses\" of the cells (Figure 1.1). In the mitochondria, the pyruvate, which have been converted into a 2-carbon molecule, enter the Krebs cycle. Notice that mitochondria have an inner membrane with many folds, called cristae. These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface area where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place. 3. In stage three, the energy in the energy carriers enters an electron transport chain. During this step, this energy is used to produce ATP. Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP. The initial step releases just two molecules of ATP for each glucose. The later steps release much more ATP. Most of the reactions of cellular respira- tion are carried out in the mitochondria. ",

        "paragraph": "Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The first life forms were single-celled organisms similar to bacteria. These first life forms were, of course, very basic, and this then allowed for the evolution of more complex life forms. The first multicellular organisms did not appear until about 610 million years ago. Many different types of organisms evolved during the next ten million years, in an event called the Cambrian Explosion. This sudden burst of evolution may have been caused by some environmental changes that made the Earths environment more suitable for a wider variety of life forms. Plants and fungi did not appear until roughly 500 million years ago. They were soon followed by arthropods (insects and spiders). Next came the amphibians about 300 million years ago, followed by mammals around 200 million years ago and birds around 100 million years ago. Even though large life forms have been very successful on Earth, most of the life forms on Earth today are still prokaryotessmall, relatively simple single-celled organisms. As it is difficult to identify, observe and study such small forms of life, most of these organisms remain unknown to scientists. Advancing technologies, however, do allow for the identification and study of such organisms. Fossils indicate that many organisms that lived long ago are extinct. Extinction of species is common; in fact, it is estimated that 99% of the species that have ever lived on Earth no longer exist. The basic timeline of a 4.6 billion-year-old Earth includes the following: About 3.5 - 3.8 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes). 3 billion years of photosynthesis. 2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes). 1 billion years of multicellular life. 600 million years of simple animals. 570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids and crustaceans). 550 million years of complex animals. 500 million years of fish and proto-amphibians. 475 million years of land plants. 400 million years of insects and seeds. 360 million years of amphibians. 300 million years of reptiles. 200 million years of mammals. 150 million years of birds. 130 million years of flowers. 65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out. 2.5 million years since the appearance of Homo. 200,000 years since the appearance of modern humans. 25,000 years since Neanderthals died out.

A gap in the sequence of rock layers is called an unconformity. Look at the rock layers in Figure 11.10. They show a feature called Huttons unconformity. The unconformity was discovered by James Hutton in the 1700s. Hutton saw that the lower rock layers are very old. The upper layers are much younger. There are no layers in between the ancient and recent layers. Hutton thought that the intermediate rock layers eroded away before the more recent rock layers were deposited. Huttons discovery was a very important event in geology! Hutton determined that the rocks were deposited over time. Some were eroded away. Hutton knew that deposition and erosion are very slow. He realized that for both to occur would take an extremely long time. This made him realize that Earth must be much older than people thought. This was a really big discovery!

        "paragraph": "Deep within the Earth, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds. You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers. In the Figure 7.6, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are folded, they do not return to their original shape. There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines. A monocline is a simple one step bend in the rock layers (Figure 7.7). In a monocline, the oldest rocks are still at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold (Figure 7.8). The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center. A syncline is a fold that bends downward (Figure 7.9). In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center. The oldest rocks are at the outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin. If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin. ",

The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure 1.1. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in the Figure 1.2, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well. Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have?

        "paragraph": "Disorders of the female reproductive system may affect the vagina, uterus, or ovaries. They may also affect the breasts. One of the most common disorders is vaginitis. This is redness and itching of the vagina. It may be due to irritation by soap or bubble bath. Another possible cause of vaginitis is a yeast infection. Yeast normally grow in the vagina. A yeast infection happens when the yeast multiply too fast and cause symptoms. A yeast infection can be treated with medication. Bubble baths may be fun, but for women and girls they can cause irritation to the vagina. A common disorder of the ovaries is an ovarian cyst. A cyst is a sac filled with fluid or other material. An ovarian cyst is usually harmless, but it may cause pain. Most cysts slowly disappear and do not need treatment. Very large or painful cysts can be removed with surgery. Many teen girls have painful menstrual periods. They typically have cramping in the lower abdomen. Generally, this is nothing to worry about. Taking a warm bath or using a heating pad often helps. Exercise can help as well. A pain reliever like ibuprofen may also work. If the pain is severe, a doctor can prescribe stronger medicine to relieve the pain. The most common type of cancer in females is breast cancer. The cancer causes the cells of the breast to grow out of control and form a tumor. Breast cancer is rare in teens. It becomes more common as women get older. If breast cancer is found early, it usually can be cured with surgery. ",

        "paragraph": "Most groundwater does not flow out of an aquifer as a spring or geyser. So to use the water thats stored in an aquifer people must go after it. How? They dig a well. A well is a hole that is dug or drilled through the ground down to an aquifer. This is illustrated in Figure 13.18. People have depended on water from wells for thousands of years.

Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on. How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure 1.1. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in the Figure 1.2, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well. Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have? A: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals. ",

Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on. How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure 1.1. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in the Figure 1.2, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well. Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have? A: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals. ",

A real image forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet. It is a true image that could be projected on a screen.

        "paragraph": "Many crops are grown where there isnt enough rainfall for plants to thrive. For example, crops are grown in deserts of the American southwest. How is this possible? The answer is irrigation. Irrigation is any way of providing extra water to plants. Most of the water used in agriculture is used for irrigation. Livestock also use water, but they use much less. Irrigation can waste a lot of water. The type of irrigation shown in Figure 21.2 is the most wasteful. The water is sprayed into the air and then falls to the ground. But much of the water never reaches the crops. Instead, it evaporates in the air or runs off the fields. Irrigation water may cause other problems. The water may dissolve agricultural chemicals such as pesticides. When the water soaks into the ground, the dissolved chemicals do, too. They may enter groundwater or run off into rivers or lakes. Salts in irrigation water can also collect in the soil. The soil may get too salty for plants to grow. ",

        "paragraph": "Geologists can learn a lot about Earths history by studying sedimentary rock layers. But in some places, theres a gap in time when no rock layers are present. A gap in the sequence of rock layers is called an unconformity. Look at the rock layers in Figure 11.10. They show a feature called Huttons unconformity. The unconformity was discovered by James Hutton in the 1700s. Hutton saw that the lower rock layers are very old. The upper layers are much younger. There are no layers in between the ancient and recent layers. Hutton thought that the intermediate rock layers eroded away before the more recent rock layers were deposited. Huttons discovery was a very important event in geology! Hutton determined that the rocks were deposited over time. Some were eroded away. Hutton knew that deposition and erosion are very slow. He realized that for both to occur would take an extremely long time. This made him realize that Earth must be much older than people thought. This was a really big discovery! It meant there was enough time for life to evolve gradually. ",

        "paragraph": "Deep within the Earth, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds. You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers. In the Figure 7.6, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are folded, they do not return to their original shape. There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines. A monocline is a simple one step bend in the rock layers (Figure 7.7). In a monocline, the oldest rocks are still at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold (Figure 7.8). The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center. A syncline is a fold that bends downward (Figure 7.9). In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center. The oldest rocks are at the outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin. If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin. ",

        "paragraph": "What does the heart look like? How does it pump blood? The heart is divided into four chambers ( Figure 1.1), or spaces: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. An atrium (singular for atria) is one of the two small, thin-walled chambers on the top of the heart where the blood first enters. A ventricle is one of the two muscular V-shaped chambers that pump blood out of the heart. You can remember they are called ventricles because they are shaped like a \"V.\" The atria receive the blood, and the ventricles pump the blood out of the heart. Each of the four chambers of the heart has a specific job. The right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body. The right ventricle pumps oxygen-poor blood toward the lungs, where it receives oxygen. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. ",

Under the unconfined aquifer, there is a layer that the water cannot penetrate. We call the layer as impermeable layer. Under the impermeable layer, a thick layer containing water is called confide aquifer. The earth region that supports the confined aquifer is called confining bed. The hole to obtain water in the unconfined aquifer is called artesian bore.",

Large lakes are divided into similar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth of about 200 m, creating the photic zone (\"photic\" means light). Organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted to the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as phytoplankton, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live in or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up the majority of the ocean, but has a relatively small amount of its life, both in diversity of type and in numbers. The aphotic zone is subdivided based on depth (Figure 1.1). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a lot more shallow than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live in. What makes it so hard to live at the bottom of the ocean? The three major factors that make the deep ocean hard to inhabit are the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. ",

        "paragraph": "To better understand regions of the ocean, scientists define the water column by depth. They divide the entire ocean into two zones vertically, based on light level. Large lakes are divided into similar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth of about 200 m, creating the photic zone (\"photic\" means light). Organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted to the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as phytoplankton, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live in or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up the majority of the ocean, but has a relatively small amount of its life, both in diversity of type and in numbers. The aphotic zone is subdivided based on depth (Figure 1.1). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a lot more shallow than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live in. What makes it so hard to live at the bottom of the ocean? The three major factors that make the deep ocean hard to inhabit are the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. ",

The continental slope is the slope that forms the edge of the continent. It is seaward of the continental shelf. In some places, a large pile of sediments brought from rivers creates the continental rise. The continental rise ends at the Besides seamounts, there are long, very tall (about 2 km) mountain ranges. These ranges are connected so that they form huge ridge systems called mid-ocean ridges (Figure 2.11). The mid-ocean ridges form from volcanic eruptions. Lava from inside Earth breaks through the crust and creates the mountains. The deepest places of the ocean are the ocean trenches. Many trenches line the edges of the Pacific Ocean. The Mariana Trench is the deepest place in the ocean. (Figure 2.12). At about 11 km deep, it is the deepest place on Earth!

        "paragraph": "This diagram shows the ocean floor. Like land terrains, the ocean floor also has ridges, valleys, plains and volcanoes. The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean. The oceanic zone begins in the area off shore where the water measures 200 meters (656 feet) deep or deeper. It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean's completely open water. The photic zone or sunlight zone is the depth of the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates compensation point. The aphotic zone is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. The abyssal zone is the layer of the pelagic zone of the ocean. At depths of 4,000 to 6,000 metres (13,123 to 19,685 feet), this zone remains in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight. The continental shelf is the area of the seabed around a large landmass where the sea is relatively shallow compared with the open ocean. This is geologically part of the continental crust.

These ranges are connected so that they form huge ridge systems called mid-ocean ridges (Figure 2.11). The mid-ocean ridges form from volcanic eruptions.

Sea level rises over the land during a marine transgression. During a marine regression, sea level retreats. During the Paleozoic there were four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions. There were two additional cycles during the Mesozoic (Figure 1.1). One of two things must happen for sea level to change in a marine transgression: either the land must sink or the water level must rise. What could cause sea level to rise? When little or no fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice caps, sea level is high. Sea level also appears to rise if land is down dropped. Sea level rises if an increase in seafloor spreading rate buoys up the ocean crust, causing the ocean basin to become smaller. What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Six marine transgressions and regres- sions have occurred during the Phanero- zoic. Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and regressions were the result of the decrease and increase in the size of glaciers covering the lands.

These ranges are connected so that they form huge ridge systems called mid-ocean ridges (Figure 2.11). The mid-ocean ridges form from volcanic eruptions.

        "paragraph": "This diagram shows the ocean floor. Like land terrains, the ocean floor also has ridges, valleys, plains and volcanoes. The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean. The oceanic zone begins in the area off shore where the water measures 200 meters (656 feet) deep or deeper. It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean's completely open water. The photic zone or sunlight zone is the depth of the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates compensation point. The aphotic zone is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. The abyssal zone is the layer of the pelagic zone of the ocean. At depths of 4,000 to 6,000 metres (13,123 to 19,685 feet), this zone remains in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight. The continental shelf is the area of the seabed around a large landmass where the sea is relatively shallow compared with the open ocean. This is geologically part of the continental crust. Studying the ocean floor is difficult because the environment is so hostile but scientists have discovered good ways to study the ocean floor through the years. Some ways are by using a sonar and special vehicles (some of which can even be done remotely).",

        "paragraph": "To better understand regions of the ocean, scientists define the water column by depth. They divide the entire ocean into two zones vertically, based on light level. Large lakes are divided into similar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth of about 200 m, creating the photic zone (\"photic\" means light). Organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted to the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as phytoplankton, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live in or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up the majority of the ocean, but has a relatively small amount of its life, both in diversity of type and in numbers. The aphotic zone is subdivided based on depth (Figure 1.1). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a lot more shallow than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live in. What makes it so hard to live at the bottom of the ocean? The three major factors that make the deep ocean hard to inhabit are the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. ",

It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean's completely open water. The photic zone or sunlight zone is the depth of the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates compensation point. The aphotic zone is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. The abyssal zone is the layer of the pelagic zone of the ocean. At depths of 4,000 to 6,000 metres (13,123 to 19,685 feet), this zone remains in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight. The continental shelf is the area of the seabed around a large landmass where the sea is relatively shallow compared with the open ocean. This is geologically part of the continental crust. Studying the ocean floor is difficult because the environment is so hostile but scientists have discovered good ways to study the ocean floor through the years.

The last three zones have no sunlight at all. The Habitat zone is formed by 5 mini zones: Abbysal, Bathyal, Hadal, Neritic, and Oceanic. One-third of the Earth is made up of the Abbysal zone. It is very cold and dark in this zone. In the Bathyal zone, the food and temperature easily fall into the deepest zones of the ocean. The Hadal zone is the deepest zone in the ocean. It has high-pressure conditions and it's really cold. The Neritic zone is rich in plants, animals, and nutrients that are carried by currents of land. In the Oceanic zone, there is an abundant life of plankton.",

        "paragraph": "To better understand regions of the ocean, scientists define the water column by depth. They divide the entire ocean into two zones vertically, based on light level. Large lakes are divided into similar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth of about 200 m, creating the photic zone (\"photic\" means light). Organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted to the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as phytoplankton, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live in or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up the majority of the ocean, but has a relatively small amount of its life, both in diversity of type and in numbers. The aphotic zone is subdivided based on depth (Figure 1.1). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a lot more shallow than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live in. What makes it so hard to live at the bottom of the ocean? The three major factors that make the deep ocean hard to inhabit are the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. ",

You can see an example of an intertidal zone in Figure 23.21. There are plenty of nutrients and sunlight in the intertidal zone. Producers here include phytoplankton and algae. Other organisms include barnacles, snails, crabs, and mussels. They must have adaptations for the constantly changing conditions in this zone.

        "paragraph": "Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave passes through. The resting position of a particle of the medium is where the particle would be in the absence of a wave. The Figure 1.1 show the amplitudes of two different types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves. In a transverse wave, particles of the medium move up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave. Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between the crest and the resting position. The crest is the highest point particles of the medium reach. The higher the crests are, the greater the amplitude of the wave. In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave. Wave amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by the wave. The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave.

Figure 14.14 shows the position of the Moon relative to the Sun at different times during the month. The positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other determines how the Sun affects tides. This creates spring tides or neap tides. Spring tides occur during the new moon and full moon. The Sun and Moon are in a straight line either on the same side of Earth or on opposite sides. Their gravitational pull combines to cause very high and very low tides. Spring tides have the greatest tidal range. Neap tides occur during the first and third quarters of the Moon. The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other. Their gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and lows are not as great. Neap tides have the smallest tidal range.

        "paragraph": "Tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place. The pull of the Moons gravity on Earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the Suns gravity on Earth is the secondary cause (Figure 1.1). The Moon has a greater effect because, although it is much smaller than the Sun, it is much closer. The Moons pull is about twice that of the Suns. To understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the Moon on Earth. As the Moon revolves around our planet, its gravity pulls Earth toward it. The lithosphere is unable to move much, but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created. This bulge is the high tide beneath the Moon. On the other side of the Earth, a high tide is produced where the Moons pull is weakest. These two water bulges on opposite sides of the Earth aligned with the Moon are the high tides. The places directly in between the high tides are low tides. As the Earth rotates beneath the Moon, a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day. High tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes. The reason is that the Moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the Earth, so the Moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Since high tides occur twice a day, one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes. What is the time between a high tide and the next low tide? The gravity of the Sun also pulls Earths water towards it and causes its own tides. Because the Sun is so far away, its pull is smaller than the Moons. Some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all. These coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides. These differences are often because of local conditions, such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering. The gravitational attraction of the Moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides. ",

It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean's completely open water. The photic zone or sunlight zone is the depth of the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates compensation point. The aphotic zone is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. The abyssal zone is the layer of the pelagic zone of the ocean. At depths of 4,000 to 6,000 metres (13,123 to 19,685 feet), this zone remains in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight. The continental shelf is the area of the seabed around a large landmass where the sea is relatively shallow compared with the open ocean. This is geologically part of the continental crust. Studying the ocean floor is difficult because the environment is so hostile but scientists have discovered good ways to study the ocean floor through the years.

        "paragraph": "This diagram represents the different positions of the Sun and moon in relation to the Earth, with two different types of tides. The positions of the Sun and moon affect tides, because the Sun's gravity determines how much influence the moon has on tides. Spring tides occur during new moon and full moon, because the Sun and moon are in a straight line, and their combined gravity causes extreme tides on Earth (high or low). Neap tides happen when the moon is in 1st quarter or third quarter, because since the Sun and moon are not in line here, the gravity is weaker and the tides do not have as great of a range. So, spring tides and neap tides are essentially opposite concepts. As you can see in Diagram A, the light blue area around the Earth represents the amount of tide, and there are extreme highs and lows. In Diagram B, the light blue area is more averaged out around the globe.",

Gravity keeps the Earth and Moon in their orbits. Earths gravity pulls the Moon toward Earths center. Without gravity, the Moon would continue moving in a straight line off into space. All objects in the universe have a gravitational attraction to each other (Figure 24.5). The strength of the force of gravity depends on two things. They are the mass of the objects and the distance between them. The greater the objects mass, the greater the force of attraction. As the distance between the objects increases, the force of attraction decreases. ",

As the moon moves around the earth, we see different parts of the moon lit up by the sun. This causes the phases of the moon. A full moon occurs when the whole side facing earth is lit. This happens when earth is between the moon and the sun. About one week later, the moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the moon's lit surface is visible from earth, so it appears as a half circle. When the moon moves between earth and the sun, the side facing earth is completely dark. This is called the new moon phase. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the earth and hits the moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the moon is more than half lit. It is not full. The moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.",

The resting position of a particle of the medium is where the particle would be in the absence of a wave. The Figure 1.1 show the amplitudes of two different types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves. In a transverse wave, particles of the medium move up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave. Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height between the crest and the resting position. The crest is the highest point particles of the medium reach. The higher the crests are, the greater the amplitude of the wave. In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave. Wave amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is compressed by the wave. The closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave.

        "paragraph": "Some of the most important events of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic were the rising and falling of sea level over the continents. Sea level rises over the land during a marine transgression. During a marine regression, sea level retreats. During the Paleozoic there were four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions. There were two additional cycles during the Mesozoic (Figure 1.1). One of two things must happen for sea level to change in a marine transgression: either the land must sink or the water level must rise. What could cause sea level to rise? When little or no fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice caps, sea level is high. Sea level also appears to rise if land is down dropped. Sea level rises if an increase in seafloor spreading rate buoys up the ocean crust, causing the ocean basin to become smaller. What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Six marine transgressions and regres- sions have occurred during the Phanero- zoic. Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and regressions were the result of the decrease and increase in the size of glaciers covering the lands.

Sea level rises over the land during a marine transgression. During a marine regression, sea level retreats. During the Paleozoic there were four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions. There were two additional cycles during the Mesozoic (Figure 1.1). One of two things must happen for sea level to change in a marine transgression: either the land must sink or the water level must rise. What could cause sea level to rise? When little or no fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice caps, sea level is high. Sea level also appears to rise if land is down dropped. Sea level rises if an increase in seafloor spreading rate buoys up the ocean crust, causing the ocean basin to become smaller. What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Six marine transgressions and regres- sions have occurred during the Phanero- zoic. Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and regressions were the result of the decrease and increase in the size of glaciers covering the lands.

The positions of the Sun and moon affect tides, because the Sun's gravity determines how much influence the moon has on tides. Spring tides occur during new moon and full moon, because the Sun and moon are in a straight line, and their combined gravity causes extreme tides on Earth (high or low). Neap tides happen when the moon is in 1st quarter or third quarter, because since the Sun and moon are not in line here, the gravity is weaker and the tides do not have as great of a range. So, spring tides and neap tides are essentially opposite concepts. As you can see in Diagram A, the light blue area around the Earth represents the amount of tide, and there are extreme highs and lows. In Diagram B, the light blue area is more averaged out around the globe.",

This process is called upwelling (Figure 1.2). Upwelling forces denser water from below to take the place of less dense water at the surface that is pushed away by the wind. Generally, upwelling occurs along the coast when wind blows water strongly away from the shore. This leaves a void that is filled by deep water that rises to the surface. Upwelling is extremely important where it occurs. During its time on the bottom, the cold deep water has collected nutrients that have fallen down through the water column. Upwelling brings those nutrients to the surface. Those nutrients support the growth of plankton and form the base of a rich ecosystem. California, South America, South Africa, and the Arabian Sea all benefit from offshore upwelling. Upwelling also takes place along the Equator between the North and South Equatorial Currents. Winds blow the surface water north and south of the Equator, so deep water undergoes upwelling. The nutrients rise to the surface and support a great deal of life in the equatorial oceans.

This causes a bulge of water on that side of Earth. That bulge is a high tide. Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moons gravity than is the ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon. As a result, there is bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth. This creates another high tide. With water bulging on two sides of Earth, theres less water left in between.

        "paragraph": "The diagram shows the different phases of moon. The moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reflects light from the sun. As the moon moves around the earth, we see different parts of the moon lit up by the sun. This causes the phases of the moon. A full moon occurs when the whole side facing earth is lit. This happens when earth is between the moon and the sun. About one week later, the moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the moon's lit surface is visible from earth, so it appears as a half circle. When the moon moves between earth and the sun, the side facing earth is completely dark. This is called the new moon phase. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the earth and hits the moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the moon is more than half lit. It is not full. The moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.",

        "paragraph": "Tides are the daily rise and fall of sea level at any given place. The pull of the Moons gravity on Earth is the primary cause of tides and the pull of the Suns gravity on Earth is the secondary cause (Figure 1.1). The Moon has a greater effect because, although it is much smaller than the Sun, it is much closer. The Moons pull is about twice that of the Suns. To understand the tides it is easiest to start with the effect of the Moon on Earth. As the Moon revolves around our planet, its gravity pulls Earth toward it. The lithosphere is unable to move much, but the water is pulled by the gravity and a bulge is created. This bulge is the high tide beneath the Moon. On the other side of the Earth, a high tide is produced where the Moons pull is weakest. These two water bulges on opposite sides of the Earth aligned with the Moon are the high tides. The places directly in between the high tides are low tides. As the Earth rotates beneath the Moon, a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides approximately every day. High tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes. The reason is that the Moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to rotate once around the Earth, so the Moon is over the same location every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Since high tides occur twice a day, one arrives each 12 hours and 25 minutes. What is the time between a high tide and the next low tide? The gravity of the Sun also pulls Earths water towards it and causes its own tides. Because the Sun is so far away, its pull is smaller than the Moons. Some coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all. These coastal areas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different amount of time between two high tides. These differences are often because of local conditions, such as the shape of the coastline that the tide is entering. The gravitational attraction of the Moon to ocean water creates the high and low tides. ",

However, the moon becomes visible to us due to its capability to reflect light from the sun. As it moves around the Earth, we see these phases that result from the different angles the moon makes with the sun. A New Moon occurs when the side of the moon facing the earth is not illuminated by the sun. After a few days, a thin crescent shape of the moon becomes visible in the night sky. The crescent moon waxes, or appears to grow fatter, each night. When half of the moon is illuminated, it is called a First Quarter moon. The moon continues to wax, forms a gibbous shape, until it eventually becomes a Full Moon. This now means that the moon has completed one half of a month.

However, there are actually two different kinds of rotation that need to be considered here. For one, there's the amount of time it takes for the Earth to turn once on its axis so that it returns to the same orientation compared to the rest of the Universe. Then there's how long it takes for the Earth to turn so that the Sun returns to the same spot in the sky. Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds.",

Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on. How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure 1.1. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in the Figure 1.2, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well. Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have? A: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals. ",

Spring tides occur during new moon and full moon, because the Sun and moon are in a straight line, and their combined gravity causes extreme tides on Earth (high or low). Neap tides happen when the moon is in 1st quarter or third quarter, because since the Sun and moon are not in line here, the gravity is weaker and the tides do not have as great of a range. So, spring tides and neap tides are essentially opposite concepts.

This happens when earth is between the moon and the sun. About one week later, the moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the moon's lit surface is visible from earth, so it appears as a half circle. When the moon moves between earth and the sun, the side facing earth is completely dark. This is called the new moon phase. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the earth and hits the moon.

        "paragraph": "If you look at the diagram of high and low tides on a circular Earth above, youll see that tides are waves. So when the Sun and Moon are aligned, what do you expect the tides to look like? Waves are additive, so when the gravitational pull of both bodies is in the same direction, the high tides are higher and the low tides lower than at other times through the month (Figure 1.3). These more extreme tides, with a greater tidal range, are called spring tides. Spring tides dont just occur in the spring; they occur whenever the Moon is in a new-moon or full-moon phase, about every 14 days. Neap tides are tides that have the smallest tidal range, and they occur when the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun form a 90o angle (Figure 1.4). They occur exactly halfway between the spring tides, when the Moon is at first or last quarter. How do the tides add up to create neap tides? The Moons high tide occurs in the same place as the Suns low tide and the Moons low tide in the same place as the Suns high tide. At neap tides, the tidal range is relatively small. The tidal range is the difference between the ocean level at high tide and low tide. Studying ocean tides rhythmic movements helps scientists understand the ocean and the Sun/Moon/Earth system.

        "paragraph": "This diagram shows the ocean floor. Like land terrains, the ocean floor also has ridges, valleys, plains and volcanoes. The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean. The oceanic zone begins in the area off shore where the water measures 200 meters (656 feet) deep or deeper. It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean's completely open water. The photic zone or sunlight zone is the depth of the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates compensation point. The aphotic zone is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. The abyssal zone is the layer of the pelagic zone of the ocean. At depths of 4,000 to 6,000 metres (13,123 to 19,685 feet), this zone remains in perpetual darkness and never receives daylight. The continental shelf is the area of the seabed around a large landmass where the sea is relatively shallow compared with the open ocean. This is geologically part of the continental crust. Studying the ocean floor is difficult because the environment is so hostile but scientists have discovered good ways to study the ocean floor through the years. Some ways are by using a sonar and special vehicles (some of which can even be done remotely).",
